    "# Tutorial for Graph Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hand-on code tutorial, we will show how to generate graphs using our DIG library. Specifically, we show how to use the implemented GraphEBM and GraphDF methods to create molecular graph generators with deep generative models.\n",

    "## Graph Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In drug discovery and chemical science, a fundamental problem is to design and synthesize novel molecules with some desirable properties (e.g. high drug-likeness). This problem remains to be very challenging, because the space of molecules is discrete and very huge. A promising solution is to construct a graph generator which can automatically generate novel molecular graphs. Recently, many approaches are proposed for molecular graph generation, such as JT-VAE, GCPN, GraphAF, GraphEBM, and GraphDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate molecular graphs, we first need to decide what is generated to form a molecular graph. Generally, the following three graph formation methods are most widely used in existing molecular graph generation approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tree-based method. The tree structure of a molecule is firstly generated, where the nodes of tree represent a motif or subgraph of the molecular graph, e.g., an aromatic ring. Then, for any two connected subgraphs in the tree, the binding points between them are decided, and a molecular graph is finally formed by binding all subgraphs. An example of this method is JT-VAE.\n",
    "* One-shot method. The molecular graph is formed by explicitly generating its node type matrix and adjacency tensor. Examples of this method are GraphVAE and GraphEBM.\n",
    "* Sequential method. The molecular graph is formed step by step, where only one node or one edge is generated in each step. Examples of this method are GCPN, GraphAF and GraphDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the molecular graph formation method is determined, we can use any deep generative model (e.g. VAE, GAN, and flow) to construct a graph generator, in which latent variables are mapped to the generation targets by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use [GraphEBM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00546) and [GraphDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01189) as examples to show how to use one-shot and sequential methods in the molecular graph generation problem, separately. Specifically, we will show how to use our implemented APIs to quickly running training and generation on the ZINC250k dataset with code examples."
